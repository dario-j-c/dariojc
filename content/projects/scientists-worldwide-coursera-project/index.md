This project uses both SPARQL to query Wikipedia and Shiny for developing & hosting the app. It pulls all individuals listed as scientists on Wikipedia and displays where they were born, as well as their birth dates. It also allows you to filter by location or date and explore the locations on a dynamic map.

I would like to expand it in the future to break down the scientific field by categories and maybe the same with gender, but I'm currently limited by the allowed query for Wikipedia and more importantly, the space allowance by Shiny.

Please note, this app is hosted on the free version of Shiny and thus may not be available if the amount of allowed monthly usage has been surpassed.
