Dario Clarke is an energy analyst who dipped his toes much too deeply into data analytics and found he liked it.

He hails from the vibrant island of Barbados where he works in the renewable energy sector.

This website is simply a claim to a little part of the reef in the sea of information where he can speak his thoughts.
